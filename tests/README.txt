This directory contains test suite definitions that aggregate test
suites from other libraries.  Test suites for specific libraries
are in a "tests" subdirectory of the specific library.

Note: the all-libraries-test-suite is named that way (including
"all-") so as not to conflict with the fundev "libraries-test-suite"
library.  Better ideas?
