This is the Gwydion Dylan version of the Open Dylan sql and sql-odbc
libraries. This library resolves incompatibilities between OD and GD in the
realms of garbage collection and C-FFI. The exposed API should be identical to
that of Open Dylan's sql and sql-odbc libraries, except for the following
changes:

  *trace-odbc-functions* is defined, but doesn't do anything.

  close-dbms(<dbms>) and close-statement(<database-statement>) were added.
  Finalization is not implemented in GD. Be sure to call close-dbms,
  disconnect, or close-statement when done with the relevant objects.

What still needs to be done:

  Testing. Neither the Gwydion Dylan nor the Open Dylan versions of the sql
  and sql-odbc seem to work with MySQL, yet MySQL is all I have. So, this
  library needs to be tested against a database with which the Open Dylan
  version is known to work.
