Fix before going live
---------------------

Anything that is a regression compared to the original wiki.

* Preserve dates during import of old pages.
* Implement preview
* Implement diff
* Convert the content in www.opendylan.org to wiki pages and make
  them only editable by the dylan-hackers group.
* The methods on permanent-link are incorrect.  For example, if you go
  to the "connections" page via the "versions" page, all the connection
  page links are incorrect.  Maybe transform-uris is broken.  Maybe we
  should be using <web-locator>s instead.
* Write all the hard-linked pages in the navigation bar (and the news items)
  in the old wiki so they're available immediately after conversion.  All
  we need to do after conversion is add the "news" tag.

General
-------
* MAKE THREAD SAFE -- basically anything like removing a user, which
  modifies multiple objects, may have race conditions.  Needs careful
  thought.
* Convert specialized DSP tags to use <dsp:loop> and improve <dsp:loop>
  as needed.
* navigation.dsp should be able to include wiki pages so that it can
  be customizable on a per-site and/or per-user basis.
* i18n

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
* IE7 doesn't make all the links in the left nav menu active.
  Something in the style sheet breaks it.  This makes it fairly
  useless.
* Safari: login doesn't work.  See IRC comments on 2009-06-15.
* Test with Opera

Feeds
-----
* Is there a secure way to make page feeds respect ACLs?  For
  now they just show publicly viewable pages.
* Fix various problems shown by http://www.feedvalidator.org/
* Include more info in the entry descriptions.  For pages, maybe
  include the diff up to a certain size limit?
* Limit feeds to a certain time period.  Not sure how this is
  normally done yet.

Markup Language
---------------
* Support ReStructured Text as a markup language, probably doing a first
  pass over the source to process wiki links etc and then pass the result
  to rst2html, since it hardly seems wise to re-implement all of RST.
  Virtually all the features/bugs listed in the old "Wiki To-Do List"
  wiki page are solved by this.
* Support the original markup language until all pages have been converted
  to something newer.

Tags
----
* Overview page (hannes: what do you have in mind exactly?)
* Ability to browse all pages with a given set of tags.
* Make reserved tags and the "news" tag configurable.

Users
-----
* Don't store passwords in cleartext.
* Show non-activated accounts in the Users list (maybe only to admins?)
  and allow admins to edit/activate the accounts.  Might be nice to have
  an icon that indicates data that is only shown to admins.
* Show the email address if the user him/herself is viewing the page.
* When an admin is editing a user, allow them to make the user an admin.
  (This is where the two levels of admin could come into play.)
* Support a full name attribute.
* Have a "home" wiki page for each user, similar to twiki.  Pre-create
  the page.  Maybe call it e.g. "User: Full Name".
* Allow user to set their timezone and date format, and show all times
  relative to that.
* Validate name, password, email.  Require a minimum level of
  security in passwords?  e.g., must not be empty, one char, all the
  same char, etc.  Maybe there's a cookbook for this.

Registration
------------
* The account activation key is just base-64 encoded.  Not very secure,
  just minimally good enough for now.
* Put initial focus in password field.

Groups
------
* Options menu offers edit/remove even if the user is not owner or admin.
* Remove group from any ACLs upon deletion, and display list of pages whos
  ACLs will be affected.  Bonus points: say whether removing the group will
  make it so that no one (other than an admin and the owner) has access to
  a page.
* Show "This group has no members" if true.
* Combine editing attributes and group members onto one page.  This requires
  javascript to do it right, i.e. not require a POST for each member change.

Pages
-----
* The "Pages" page, linked in the left margin, lists all pages.  It should
  list ~20 pages per page and put up "<< 1, 2, 3 ... n >>" links at the bottom.
  Or something.  It's a good excuse to develop a built-in mechanism for doing
  that in DSP.
* Conflict detection (multiple overlapping edits)
* improve display of tags.  maybe put to the right of the title.
* looks like page versions aren't quite correct yet.
  e.g., do they always show the latest tags?
* should be a way to include other pages inline.
* Allow owner or administrator to change page owner when editing page.
* When viewing a non-newest revision, the options menu items are incorrect.
  e.g., "edit" loads the newest revision's content.  Instead it should
  load the old content and give a warning near the Save button that you
  are editing an older revision.  "remove" probably shouldn't be there,
  and "connections" should show the connections of the older revision.
* A way to set ACLs for multiple pages at once.  How to choose the pages?
  By tags, by owner, by reference, by backlink?
