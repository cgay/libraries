General
-------
* MAKE THREAD SAFE -- basically anything like removing a user, which
  modifies multiple objects, may have race conditions.  Needs careful
  thought.
* Convert specialized tags to use <dsp:loop> and improve <dsp:loop>
  as needed.
* navigation.dsp should be able to include wiki pages so that it can
  be customizable on a per-site and/or per-user basis.
* i18n

Tags
----

* The way news items are implemented (by adding a special tag) means
  that anyone can add a news item.  Probably just add a set of
  reserved tags in the config file.  (Reserved for admins, I guess.)
  Not worth generalizing the ACLs stuff to tags, I think.

Users
-----
* Don't store passwords in cleartext.
* If you get an error when creating a user (e.g., don't enter a password)
  the username isn't displayed on the followup page.
* Show the email address if the user him/herself is viewing the page.
* When an admin is editing a user, allow them to make the user an admin.
  (This is where the two levels of admin could come into play.)
* Support a full name attribute.
* Have a "home" wiki page for each user.  similar to twiki

Registration
------------
* Validate email addresses by sending to them and not enabling the
  account until verified.
* Should have its own page
* Should give error if no username entered
* Should leave you logged in
* Should put initial focus in password field

Groups
------
* Remove group from any ACLs upon deletion, and display list of pages whos
  ACLs will be affected.  Bonus points: say whether removing the group will
  make it so that no one (other than an admin and the owner) has access to
  a page.
* Show "This group has no members" if true.
* Combine editing attributes and group members onto one page.  This requires
  javascript to do it right, i.e. not require a POST for each member change.

Pages
-----
* The "Pages" page, linked in the left margin, lists all pages.  It should
  list ~20 pages per page and put up "<< 1, 2, 3 ... n >>" links at the bottom.
  Or something.  It's a good excuse to develop a built-in mechanism for doing
  that in DSP.
* Conflict detection (multiple overlapping edits)
* improve display of tags.  maybe put to the right of the title.
* looks like page versions aren't quite correct yet.
  e.g., do they always show the latest tags?
* should be a way to include other pages inline.
* Allow owner or administrator to change page owner when editing page.
* When viewing a non-newest revision, the options menu items are incorrect.
  e.g., "edit" loads the newest revision's content.  Instead it should
  load the old content and give a warning near the Save button that you
  are editing an older revision.  "remove" probably shouldn't be there,
  and "connections" should show the connections of the older revision.
