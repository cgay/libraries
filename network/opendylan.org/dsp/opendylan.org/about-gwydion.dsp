<od:standard-header>Where does this strange name come from?</od:standard-header>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwydion">Gwydion</a> is a
character from the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a>, a Welsh
tale almost a thousand years old.

<p>Gwydion is a powerful sorceror and master of illusion. He delights
in trickery and is thought to have originated April Fools' Day when he
conjured up armies to trick Aranrhod into arming Lleu. He is a lover
of poetry and the art of the bards, and is the druid of the gods. He
is persistent in his ventures and learns from experience. He is both
subtle and devious, yet open and honest in his dealings with
others. He takes responsibility in his actions and in the actions of
his people.

<p>Gwydion is the father of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Eil_Ton">Dylan</a> in that
story.
