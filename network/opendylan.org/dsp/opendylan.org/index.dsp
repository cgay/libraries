<EM>Dylan is an advanced, object-oriented, dynamic language which supports
rapid program development.  When needed, programs can be optimized for more
efficient execution by supplying more type information to the compiler.  Nearly
all entities in Dylan (including functions, classes, and basic data types such
as integers) are first class objects. Additionally Dylan supports multiple
inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword arguments, object
introspection, macros, and many other advanced features...  --Peter Hinely</EM>
