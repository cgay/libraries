BUGS:
<day/time-duration>
 -> escape '/' because it is used as delimiter for library/module/symbol

TODO:
general:
 * link to specific method in a GF (using argument types)
 * URL schema: add optional ?project=foo, where project should default to library name

*library: modules which are exported
*module: names which are exported
*class: get rid of "complex type"
*search:
  display project-name instead of library name!
  display project, library and module where the symbol was found!

implement dsp and tags for
 *constant
 *domain
 *generic-function
 *method
 *simple-function
 *macro
 *module-variable

draw nice graphs! (module/library deps|call deps|class graphs|...)
