TEST:
* reverse zones are hardcoded to be at a /24 boundary,
   they should be byte-bounded

BUGS:
* a-records and c-names with same name as any host record
   -> parent is the list of a-records, not the zone
* check for length of strings, and elements of the strings
   (a-record, hostname, vlan-name, mx-name, cname-name, ..)
* when using "" in vlan description it fails in edit form...
  => some more escaping needed

FEATURE REQUESTS

*user management:
 *at least security levels:
   0 root
   1 noc (who knows what he is doing), but may not change user rights
   2 helpdesk (add hosts to some specific subnets,
                  view everything)
   3 viewer

   4 participiant (yourname)
   (5 view (no authentication, may only browse all stuff
         (apart from entered passwords,
          list of mac-address and ip, recent changes?))
 *put obj-tables in user session objects

*aaaa, srv, naptr, txt dns records
*host-records:
 foo.vlanx.congress.ccc.de IN MX 10 example.com.

security:
 -prevent cross-site scripting (escape nearly everything in all input data,
  maybe enki's framework-stuff andreas implemented in dylan on his laptop)


data structure
==============
* to solve the a-record and c-name problem: use a central hash table to store
   all records, or at least a method to iterate over all used names
* maybe add a description to <host>
* add a list of comments for each object
   (each user can remove/edit his comments and add a comment)

user interface
==============
* show vlan id of subnet in "add host"
* user page - only via http, not https (stunnel -> rem_ip = 127.0.0.1)
  => for something like yourname, having the possibility to enter a
     host name (static lease, dns a record, ptr record) for a IP
* maybe add a remove-field to the vlan view
* add a list of recent changes to each object page
  (using atom and a category for each web-class, probably, so having
    gathered recent changes on a list pages)
* atom/rss feeds of recent changes
* list of monitoring switch/switchport/subnet/vlan/dhcp-working stuff
* automatic fill of formular fields (probably with javascript - ajax)
   *when adding host use ip to fill in subnet-field
* switch plans (so poc can say which lines they need for their phone stuff)
    (roh suggested that)
* when adding host, return to add-host page (or have the possibility to
   add an add-form on the add-host page... with ajax stuff) or add an add-form
   on the list-page
* alias (url) for any page to get a permanent link
* generic filter for object groups (has-a things?)
   * so filtering recent changes on networks, subnets,...
     * and filtering hosts on subnet, zone, etc
   => ajax would be useful here, too
* url structure (maybe look what ruby on rails does here..),
    don't pass too much arguments via ?foo=bar&

*IPv6
 *subnet, dns (ptr, a)
 *yourname also needs to know about v6

renumbering of subnets:
 => automatically change ips of hosts
 => also dns records (reverse, forward)

autoconfig stuff:
 *blackhole ip-ranges (on junos?, force)
  => requested by abuse phone
 *automatic save of all switch & router configs (need to speak to
   HP, juniper, cisco (cisco-telnet.dylan), force10, foundry)
 *autoconfig snippet to configure all vlans

*interface to get the next /XX subnet (or the next subnet with at least Y ips)
 *javascript chosing of network when adding subnet, dhcp-start, -end, -router

*caching of zones... don't increase serial if nothing changed...

*highlight where an error occured... potentially fix it
