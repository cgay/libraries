/*
How koala logging works:

Each virtual host has (potentially) three different log targets:
errors, activity, debug output.  (These target could all be the
same.)  Each virtual host has its own applicable log level.  The
most basic method for doing logging is log-message, which is
passed a <log-target> and a <log-level>.  If the log-level passed
to log-message is an instance of the active log level for the
current virtual host the the message will be logged. Otherwise
it'll be dropped on the floor.  <log-target>s allow for arbitrary
backing store for logs, like files, databases, the net, etc.
