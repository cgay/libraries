<h2>Koala HTTP Server and Template Engine</h2>

<b>What?</b>

<br>Koala is an HTTP server written in Dylan.  It includes Dylan Server
Pages (DSP), a template engine similar to JSP without scriptlets, and an
XML-RPC server/client.

<p>
<b>Status?</b>

<br>There is currently no official &quot;stable&quot; version of Koala,
but we attempt to keep the sources in good working condition.  It is
quite stable in both Linux and Windows.  There no real database support
in FunDev/Linux yet but some success was reported with linux-odbc.
There is no support for secure sockets on either platform.

Check bugzilla for a list of <a href="http://www.opendylan.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&product=Koala&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED">known Koala bugs</a>.

<p>
<b>How?</b>

<br>There is a small demo application included, which shows how to use
the features of Koala and DSP.  See <b>Contact?</b>, below, if you
have questions!  Any and all feedback appreciated.

<p>A heavily commented Koala configuration file can be found <a
href="http://www.opendylan.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/libraries/network/koala/config/koala-config.xml?view=markup">here</a>.

<p>
<b>Who?</b>

<br>The HTTP server portion of Koala was written mostly by Gail
Zacharias.  She moved on to other things before it was in a functioning
state, so Carl Gay got it to basic working order and added <a
href="dsp.html">Dylan Server Pages</a> and <a
href="http://www.xmlrpc.org">XML-RPC</a>.  The sources were re-hosted at
the <a href="http://www.gwydiondylan.org">Gwydion Dylan</a> site in
early 2004 and many others have been contributing.
