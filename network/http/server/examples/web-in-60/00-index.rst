Dylan Web in 60 Seconds
=======================

This is a series of examples showing how to do web programming in
`Dylan <http://www.opendylan.org/about-dylan.phtml>`_. It was inspired
by a version of `the same thing written for Twisted Python
<http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/web-in-60/index.html>`_. In
Twisted, it is often the case that very little code is required to get
something basic running, which has also been an inspiration to create
similarly simple APIs for the Dylan web infrastructure.
