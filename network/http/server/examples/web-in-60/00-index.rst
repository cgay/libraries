Dylan Web in 60 Seconds
=======================

This will be a series of posts about how to do web programming in
`Dylan <http://www.opendylan.org/about-dylan.phtml>`_. It was inspired
by a version of `the same thing written for Twisted Python
<http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/web-in-60/index.html>`_. In
Twisted, it is often the case that very little code is required to get
something basic running, which has also been an inspiration to create
similarly simple APIs for the Dylan web infrastructure. Dylan was
designed for large-scale programming and is generally a little more
verbose than Python, so I expect these examples to be longer than
their Twisted Python counterparts, but the extra few lines for a
simple example quickly comes out in the wash as your program gets
larger.
