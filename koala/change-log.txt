    ending without a slash.

    would result in a hung server.

  New Features:
  - Core: The "Connection: Keep-alive" header is now respected.

           Start the example and use the "ping" and "echo" methods to test.

  - Core: New config variable 'auto-register'.  See config/koala-config.xml

           other than application/x-www-form-url-encoded.  See request-content(<request>).
  - Core: Added the "headers" log level, to show incoming/outgoing headers if desired.
           See config/koala-config.xml
  - Core: New config file setting: <port value="n" />
  - Core: Some statistics/utilities are now available via built-in URIs:
           /koala/stats, /koala/user-agents, /koala/http-error?code=xxx

    requires recompilation to change certain settings.
