renumbering of subnets:
 => automatically change ips of hosts
 => also dns records

blackhole ip-ranges
 => requested by abuse phone

dynamic forms
 => dhcp options can be multiple lines

user management

prevent cross-site scripting (escape <> in all input data)

interface to get the next /XX subnet (or the next subnet with at least Y ips)

with-xml:collect only works for elements, not for lists of elements

the following doesn't work (reference to undefined binding "collect" (but
collect is defined unhygienic in with-xml macro, do-clause, any ideas?
bug in functional-developer?)
 define macro add-form-helper
   { add-form-helper(?type:name) end }
     => { define method add-form (type == ?#"type")
            with-xml()
              form (action => "/edit", \method => "post")
              {
                div (class => "edit")
                {
                  do(for(slot in ?type.slot-descriptors)
                       let name = slot.slot-getter.debug-name;
                       collect(with-xml()
                                 text(name)
                               end);
                       collect(with-xml()
                                 input(type => "text",
                                       name => name)
                               end);
                       collect(with-xml() br end);
                     end;
                  input(type => "submit",
                        name => "add-button",
                        value => "Add")
