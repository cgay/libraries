renumbering of subnets:
 => automatically change ips of hosts
 => also dns records

blackhole ip-ranges
 => requested by abuse phone

user management

security:
 -prevent cross-site scripting (escape <> in all input data)
 -put obj-table in each session...
 -everyone is able to delete everything (he only has to give the
  correct obj-id and use remove-object as action, so only put those
  objects in his obj-table which he needs access to...

interface to get the next /XX subnet (or the next subnet with at least Y ips)
 *javascript chosing of network when adding subnet, dhcp-start, -end, -router

default values for fields...

string and cname lists user interface

error check input on edit, not only on add

with-xml:collect only works for elements, not for lists of elements

the following doesn't work (reference to undefined binding "collect" (but
collect is defined unhygienic in with-xml macro, do-clause, any ideas?
bug in functional-developer?)
 define macro add-form-helper
   { add-form-helper(?type:name) end }
     => { define method add-form (type == ?#"type")
            with-xml()
              form (action => "/edit", \method => "post")
              {
                div (class => "edit")
                {
                  do(for(slot in ?type.slot-descriptors)
                       let name = slot.slot-getter.debug-name;
                       collect(with-xml()
                                 text(name)
                               end);

                                 input(type => "text",
                                       name => name)
                               end);
