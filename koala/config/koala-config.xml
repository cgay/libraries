<!-- Koala configuration file

     This file must be placed in <koala-executable>/../config/koala-config.xml
     if you want Koala to find it.

     Anything directly inside the <koala> element in this file affects
     Koala's global environment.  Later, if virtual hosts are added, anything
     inside a <virtual-host> element will override the global environment for
     that virtual host.  Ideas for what to put in here, and sometimes how to
     name them, were stolen from Apache's httpd.conf.

<!-- SERVER-ROOT is the top of the directory tree under which the
     server's configuration and log files are kept.  Other pathnames are
     merged against this one, so if they're relative they will be
     relative to this.  The server-root pathname is relative to the
     koala executable.  NOTE: This should be near the top of the config
     file since later elements will be merged against it.  -->
<!-- During development I usually run the koala-example project.
     Setting server-root here points it to the main koala directory.
     Once Koala runs on its own and web-apps are loaded from DLLs this
     should be changed. -->
