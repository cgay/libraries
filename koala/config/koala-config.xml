<!-- Koala configuration file

     Anything directly inside the <koala> element in this file affects
     Koala's global environment.  Later, if virtual hosts are added, anything
     inside a <virtual-host> element will override the global environment for
     that virtual host.  Ideas for what to put in here, and sometimes how to
     name them, were stolen from Apache's httpd.conf.

<!-- The top of the directory tree under which the server's
     configuration, error, and log files are kept.  Other pathnames
     are merged against this one, so if they're relative they will
     be relative to this.  The server-root pathname is relative to
     the koala executable.  NOTE: This should be near the top of the
     config file since later elements may be affected by it.  -->

<!-- During development I usually run the koala-example project.
     Setting server-root here points it to the main koala directory.
     Once Koala runs on its own and web-apps are loaded from DLLs this
     should be changed. -->
