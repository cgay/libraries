<!-- TODO: 
     * When koala is a bit more prime-time (e.g., when it has at least one
       production site using it, possibly gwydiondylan.org) everything in
       this file should default to the most secure setting.

<koala>

<!-- Koala configuration file

     This file must be placed in <koala-executable>/../config/koala-config.xml
     if you want Koala to find it.  For example, when running the koala-app
     project a copy of this file should be placed in the directory
     <koala-root>/sources/koala-app/config/

     Anything directly inside the <koala> element in this file affects
     Koala's global environment or the default virtual host.  Anything
     inside a <virtual-host> element applies only to that virtual host.

     (Some ideas were stolen from Apache's httpd.conf.)

  -->


<!-- If DEFAULT-VIRTUAL-HOST is enabled then requests that don't match
     any virtual host will fall back to the default vhost instead.  The
     default is enabled.
  -->
<default-virtual-host enabled="yes"/>


<!-- LOG tells Koala what kind of log messages to display.  There are six
     possible settings, from least verbose to most verbose:

       error warning info debug verbose copious

     The 'copious' log level is currently only used by Koala to display 
     HTTP headers and content.

     The log levels should be added near the beginning of this config file
     so debugging statements emitted during config file parsing can be
     displayed.
  -->
<log level="debug" />


<!-- If DEBUG-SERVER is on then Koala will not try to gracefully handle errors
     thrown during the execution of a server request.  Only turn this on when
     running inside a development environment, or the server will crash.  This
     should also be near the beginning of the log file if you want to debug
     config file loading.
  -->
<debug-server value="on" />


<!-- SERVER-ROOT is the top of the directory tree under which the
     server's configuration and log files are kept.  Other pathnames are
     merged against this one, so if they're relative they will be
     relative to this.  The server-root pathname is relative to the
     koala executable.  NOTE: This should be near the top of the config
     file since later elements will be merged against it.
  -->
<server-root location="." />


<!-- DOCUMENT-ROOT is the root of the web document hierarchy.
     It is relative to SERVER-ROOT, so in this case the document root
     is SERVER-ROOT/www.  If the document root isn't specified for a given
     virtual host, it defaults to SERVER-ROOT/<vhost-name>.  The name
     of the default virtual host is "default".
  -->
<document-root location="www" />


<!-- DIRECTORY elements can be used to grant or deny access to specific directories.
     For now the pattern is simply an initial-substring match against the requested
     URL, so "/" matches all documents.  The order of DIRECTORY elements is significant.
     If two directory patterns match the same URL, the one specified later in the
     config file will take precedence.  For now allow-directory-listing is the only
     recognized attribute (defaulting to "no").  -->
<directory pattern = "/"
           allow-directory-listing = "yes" />


<!-- Port on which to listen for HTTP requests.  Note that at top-level,
     the <port> element applies to the default virtual host.
  -->
<port value="8001" />


<!-- location of the mime-type file -->
<mime-type-map location="mime-type-map.xml" />


<!-- location and name of logfile -->
<logfile location="koala.log" />
  

<!-- unused as yet -->
<administrator
   email="you@your.domain"
   name="yourname" />


<!-- If AUTO-REGISTER is on then URLs may be automatically registered if
     they match certain patterns.  e.g., .dsp files will automatically
     be registered as Dylan Server Pages.  The default is off.
  -->
<auto-register enabled="no" />


<!-- XML-RPC server settings.
     Set enable="yes" to enable, "no" to disable.
     Set url to the URL on which the server should listen for XML-RPC requests.
     Set internal-error-fault-code to the fault code that should be returned for
     any otherwise unhandled errors that are thrown during the execution of an XML-RPC
     request.  e.g., a badly formed request, or unhandled errors in user code.
     Set debug="yes" to log the raw XML sent/received for XML-RPC calls.
  -->
<xml-rpc
  url="/RPC2"
  enable="yes"
  internal-error-fault-code="0"
  debug="no"
  />


<!-- Web Objects (needs a better name) is a way to link web forms to database
     objects.  The basic mechanism is working but it is pre-pre-alpha still.
     There is no database support on FunDev/Linux yet.
  -->
<web-objects
  database="webobj"
  />

<!-- The MODULE element loads modules out of the SERVER-ROOT/modules/ directory.
     The following loads koala-basics.dll.
     Dynamic module loading is not supported on FunDev/Linux yet.
  -->
<module name="koala-basics" />


<!-- VIRTUAL-HOST defines a new named virtual host with its own settings.
     Top-level settings apply to the default virtual host.  Here we define
     a new vhost for '127.0.0.1' with a different document root.  With this
     definition in place you will get different document root when you
     access Koala with http://127.0.0.1/ than when you access it via any
     other name (e.g. 'localhost').
  -->

<virtual-host name="127.0.0.1">

    <document-root location = "www/127.0.0.1" />

    <!-- For now, all virtual hosts must share the same port, so the
         port here has to match the port for the default vhost.
         This will eventually be fixed. -->

    <port value="8001" />
    <directory pattern = "/"
               allow-directory-listing = "no" />
