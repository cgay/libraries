<h2>Koala</h2>

Koala is an HTTP server written in Dylan.  It includes Dylan Server Pages, 
a template engine similar to JSP without scriptlets.  But because it is
written in Dylan, and can take advantage of Dylan's powerful language
features, creating web apps in it should be much more concise and
straightforward than with JSP.

<p>The HTTP server portion of Koala was written mostly by Gail Zacharias.  She
moved on to other things before it was in a functioning state, so I finished it
up and added Dylan Server Pages.

<p>The current version is v0.1.  It is provided mostly for the interest and
amusement of other Dylan programmers and is nowhere near production quality.
The current version is for Windows only.  I plan to fix this as soon as I can
by porting to <a href="http://www.gwydiondylan.org/">Gwydion Dylan</a>.  If you
want to help, let me know!

<h3>Downloading</h2>

<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
      <p>Download the current sources only: <a href="koala.zip">koala.zip</a>
      <br>Requires the <a href="http://www.functionalobjects.com/">Functional Developer</a>
      IDE to compile and run.  Open and run the koala-example.hdp project in
      koala/sources/example/.  Then point your browser at
      <a href="http://localhost:7020/demo/home.dsp">http://localhost:7020/demo/home.dsp</a>.

      <p>Download the sources and binaries: <a href="koala-0.1b.zip">koala-0.1b.zip</a>
      <br>For anyone who doesn't have Functional Developer installed but would like to
      see how Koala/DSP works.  You can start the demo application by double clicking
      on koala-example.exe in the koala/sources/example/release/ directory.
      Then point your browser at
      <a href="http://localhost:7020/demo/home.dsp">http://localhost:7020/demo/home.dsp</a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>There is a small demo application included, which shows how to use the
features of Koala and DSP.

<p>Some <b>very</b> preliminary (and far from complete) documentation on Dylan
Server Pages is <a href="prelim-doc.html">here</a>.

<p>Any and all feedback appreciated.  Send to:
