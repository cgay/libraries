Koala/DSP readme file
---------------------

This is a very preliminary release of the Koala HTTP server and
Dylan Server Pages.  Here's how the distribution is organized:

 koala/sources/koala
   The Koala HTTP server and Dylan Server Pages sources.

 koala/sources/example
   The Koala demo application.

 koala/sources/example/release
   A binary version of the demo application for anyone who doesn't have
   Functional Developer already installed.

 koala/sources/example/www
   Web pages for the demo application.

 koala/sources/example/www/doc/
   Contains some preliminary documentation.


If you don't have Functional Developer installed, you can start the
demo application by double clicking on koala-example.exe in the
koala/sources/example/release/ directory.

If you do have Functional Developer installed, open and run the
koala-example.hdp project in koala/sources/example/.  This code
only works in FunDev 2.0.  It does not work in more recent versions
(i.e., internal development versions) because of recent changes to
the locators library.

Then point your browser at http://localhost:7020/demo/home.dsp


Any and all feedback appreciated.
