* Search sources for "---TODO" and do them.

* Secure connections.  Have to finish implementing <ssl-tcp-server-socket>.

* Sessions - They should be able to work without cookies enabled, either
  by URL rewriting or ...?

* URL cleanups:
  - URLs should always begin with a / and the static file handler will
    have to remove it before calling merge-locators.  I think this is
    done.
  - Make sure that decode-url is used in all the right places to convert
    from %xx to appropriate characters.
  - Use 'url' everywhere instead of randomly using 'uri' and 'url'.
    Figure out exactly what the difference is.
  - Should use 'path' in local variables to distinguish between the a URL
    (which contains a scheme etc) and just the path.
  - Use web locators instead of strings?  Not sure it would buy much.
    Look at parse-uri and parse-request-uri, which are presently unused.
  - Have a standard API for writing a URL to the output stream so that
    it can be used to automatically include the session-id etc.

* DSP
  - Provide an API for clearing the output stream contents.  JSP has this
    and it could be useful for error recovery.
  - Provide an analog to JSP's PageContext for a page-level namespace?
    This is basically just adding a few methods to the <page> class
    that allow you to set attributes and such.  And clearing the attrs
    after the request is completed?
  - When the home page is exported as /example the links in the page
    are relative to /.  I want them to be relative to /example/.  This
    means the canonical url for the page needs to be /example/ or 
    /example/home.dsp, and when looked up via /example it needs to do
    the right thing.

* Miscellaneous
  - Replace some uses of copy-sequence with substring.  They are probably
    hold-overs from when <substring> was causing problems.
  - Look carefully at which classes and methods should be opened before
    initial release.  Best way to do this might be to try and define a
    subclass of <dylan-server-page> outside the Koala library.
  - Actually, DSP should probably be defined to use the Koala library
    rather than being part of it.  It only needs public interfaces.

* Rearrange examples into a series of pages that show one thing per page
  and has a table of contents.
