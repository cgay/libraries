* A way to ask for a list of suites/tests/checks, optionally matching a
  substring.

* A way to debug a specific suite/test/check.  e.g., -debug "name of check"

* Logging

* -progress should display the test name BEFORE running it, not after.
  And the test name should include the test hierarchy in it.

* Command line should use --foo style not -foo

* Ability to have a unique directory per test.  Logging should go to
  both a central log and to a log in the individual test directories.
  This can make it a lot easier to track down results for specific
  tests.

* Gather timing and memory usage stats for all tests, not just
  benchmarks?
