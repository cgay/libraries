Types of markup
===============

Plain text
  Blank lines separate paragraphs. Paragraphs continue until reaching a block,
  list, or bracket directive. In particular, section directives need to be
  preceded by a blank line to be recognized after a paragraph.

Blocks & lists
  These are plain text, but use hyphens, indentation, and other elements to
  make lists and blocks of various sorts.

Headings
  These are words with ASCII underlines or overlines. They indicate sections
  and sub-sections.
                
Section directives
  These are words at the beginning of a line and ending in a colon. They
  indicate special sections or properties of the current section.

Bracket directives and options
  These are bracketed text. They refer to images, footnotes, and text defined
  elsewhere, or specify options or tags for sections.

Quoted phrase
  These are words in double-quotes, single-quotes, or back-ticks. They are
  used to format phrases and hyperlinks.

Configuration
  This is a special file that sets options and can specify a table of
  contents.

The content of a section, sub-section, or footnote must be indented at the
level of the first line or deeper. Outdented content is not included in the
section. Changing the indentation begins a new paragraph (except where
expected, such as a NOTE directive). For example:

  This is a broken
    paragraph, so
    don't do this.

This will be rendered as two paragraphs:

  This is a broken
  
  paragraph, so don't
  do this.


Quoted words
============

Quoted words can be followed by bracket options, but does not have to be. The
quotes and default processing is:

  "..." - Smart quotes. Default options are [qq].
  '...' - Linked text. Default options are [qv].
  `...` - Inline code. Default options are [code].
  
When followed by bracket options, the default processing is not done. Instead,
the processing specified in the brackets is done. Bracket options are:

  unq     - A do-nothing option. Having only this is like having no options at
            all. The quotes are removed and no other processing is done unless
            other options are present.
  sic     - Do not remove quotes.
  q       - Surround text with typographical single quotes.
  qq      - Surround text with typographical double quotes.
  code    - Indicates a code excerpt. If possible, code elements are linked to
            the relevant documentation.
  term    - Indicate a technical term being defined.
  bib     - Indicates a book or article title.
  api     - Indicates an API or parameter name.
  em      - Indicates a phrase that requires emphasis.
  b       - Use bold font.
  i       - Use italic font.
  u       - Use underline.
  qv      - The quoted text will link to a specified section or URL. The section
            or URL may be specified after all the other options (and enclosed in
            quotes if it contains spaces). If the section or URL is omitted, it
            is specified by the text and the text is replaced by the actual
            section title. See "Headings and Links" below for more information.
  vi      - Same as "qv", but the linked item is also marked as a sub-topic if
            appropriate. From the Latin "vide infra," meaning "see below."

For example,

  This is "important" [em] information!

renders the word "important" in a emphasized font style and removes the
double-quotes.

Unless "sic" is specified, the original quotes are removed from around the
text.

The quoted text is not interpreted any further.

  "[list of libraries]"
  
is rendered as 
  
  [list of libraries]
  
not as a list of all libraries in the documentation.

The quoted text can be surrounded with other characters:
  
  ... "object"s [i] are ...
  ... ("object"s [i] are ...
  ... ("object"s, [i] "setting"s, [i] and others ...


Blocks and Lists
================

Blocks are made with special characters at the flush-left position of a file
or comment.

: ...
  This style of block has the same effect as a [CODE] directive.

> ...
| ...
  These styles of block has the same effect as a [EXAMPLE] or [VERBATIM]
  directive.

Lists are made of items that follow patterns. The extent of a list item is
determined with indentation (initial indentation is shown with '_' for
clarity). Blank lines between list items are optional. For all lists but the
labeled multi-column list, the list continues until it reaches a paragraph
that does not follow the list format (not including paragraphs nested inside
an item).

- text
_text continued
  Bullet list. Other bullet characters are '*', '+', 'o'.

n. text
#. text
_text continued
  Numbered list. If a number is given, numbering starts there. Letters can be
  used by typing 'a' instead of '1', for example. Other characters that can be
  used in place of a period are ':', ')'. Each list must begin with a number;
  the hash sign continues numbering within a list.
 
phrase -
_definition
_definition continued
phrase - definition
_def'n continued
  A definition list. The definition continues until indentation ends. A hyphen
  can be included in the term by quoting the term or hyphen.
  

term   column
-----  -----------
item1  defn
       defn cont

item2  defn

item3  defn
-----  ------------
  A titled n-column list. Blank lines separate items in the list. The list
  continues until the second hyphen line. The first hyphen line determines
  columns; the last column can extend past the end of the hyphen line. The
  second hyphen line does not need to be broken into columns. The hyphen lines
  can use any of the ASCII line characters listed below, but they have to match.


Headings and Links
==================

Headings mark the start of sections. Each section should ideally stand on its
own as a complete topic. Headings have ASCII-art underlines, overlines, or
midlines as follows:

  ===============      ===========
  === Heading ===  or  === Heading
  ===============      ===========
  
  ===============      ===========
  === Heading ===  or  === Heading

  === Heading ===  or  === Heading
  ===============      ===========

  === Heading ===  or  === Heading

  =======
  Heading
  =======

  Heading
  =======

The trailing midline is optional, and the overline, midline, and underline can
be any length but must be at least 3 characters long. The following characters
can be used for over-, mid-, and underlines:

  = - : . ~ ^ _ * + #

A new style (a style is the presence or absence of each line, as well as the
character used) encountered in a file or comment block creates a new,
inferior, section level. One style must be chosen to indicate the sub-section
level. By default, this is a midline of "-".

The heading (and trailing midline, if any) may be followed by a bracket option
that specifies a section tag.

Suppose we have a doc file with the following content:

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  About the Wonderland Library   [about]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ...
 
  --- Where to Download ---   [download]
  ...

  Installation
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ...
 
  --- About Us ---
  ...
 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Required Libraries               [req]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ...
 
  Installation
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ...
 
  ### Rabbit ###
  ...
 
  --- Where to Download ---   [download]
  ...

In this example, "About the Wonderland Library" and "Required Libraries" are
the highest-level sections, the "Installation" sections are inferior to them,
and the "Rabbit" section is inferior to the second "Installation" section.
Both "Where to Download" sections are actually sub-sections.

To link to a section, use a quoted phrase containing the section's title or
tag. To link to a subsection, you must use either the subsection's unique
title or the tag of the subsection's containing section followed by a "/" and
the subsection's tag. This means that if you want to link to a sub-section,
you must ensure its containing section has a tag.

 - 'About the Wonderland Library' and 'about' link to the same section.

 - 'about' is rendered as a hyperlink to "About the Wonderland Library."

 - 'required libraries', 'Required Libraries', 'req', and 'REQ' all link to
   the same section and all are rendered as "Required Libraries."

 - 'Rabbit' is a valid link. Doctower would first search for a section with a
   tag of "rabbit," and after that fails it would search for a section with
   the title of "Rabbit."

 - 'Installation' is not a valid link. There are two sections with that title.
   Duplicate section titles are not an error, but you would have to assign a
   tag to the section of interest and use it to disambiguate the link.

 - 'About Us' is a valid link. There is only one sub-section with that title.
 
 - 'Where to Download' is not a valid link. There are two sub-sections with
   that title, so you must specify 'about/download' instead. The link is
   rendered as "Where to Download."

 - You cannot link to the "Where to Download" sub-section of the "Rabbit"
   section because that section does not have a section tag. If you were to try
   'Rabbit/Where to Download' or 'Rabbit/download', Doctower would look for
   sections with those titles; since those sections don't exist, it would fail.

 - "...install the 'required libraries' [qv], then..." would render the link
   as "Required Libraries," but "...install the 'required libraries' [qv req],
   then..." would render the link as "required libraries."

The "qv" quote option may optionally be followed by an explicit title or tag. If
there is no section with that title or tag, Doctower reports an error. But if
the "qv" quote option is not followed by a explicit title or tag, then Doctower
will use the quoted text as a title or tag and will only report a warning if a
corresponding section is not found.

Only the "qv" quote option can link to a sub-section.


Section Tags
============

Section tags are not case sensitive. They cannot include spaces.


Section Directives
==================

These are words that start in the leftmost column of the current indentation
level and end with a colon.

The scope of the NOTE and WARNING directives is determined by indentation. The
scope of the SYNOPSIS directive is one paragraph; indentation is allowed but
ignored. The scope of the SUBHEADING, DISCUSSION, ARGUMENTS, CONDITIONS, VALUES,
and KEYWORDS directives is until the next section. The scope of the LIBRARY,
etc., directives is until the next topic. The other directives end after one
line.

Underlines, midlines, and overlines are allowed but ignored; they will not
affect topic structure like headers do. If used, underlines must appear on the
next line after the directive itself, and the content of the directive must
still be indented if necessary.

Only the LIBRARY, etc., and the SUBHEADING directives can have link tags.

LIBRARY|MODULE|GENERIC FUNCTION|CLASS...: title
  Start a new reference topic of that type. This new topic is set at the same
  level as the previous topic. The types are "Library," "Module," "Class,"
  "Generic Function," "Function," "Method," "Variable," "Constant," and "Macro."

TOPIC: title
  Start a new conceptual topic. It may be used as an alternative to the
  ASCII-art method of denoting a topic. The new topic is set at the same level
  as the previous topic.
  
FULLY QUALIFIED NAME: name
  May be necessary to determine which of several APIs this topic refers to.
  Only in reference topics. Doctower has a command-line switch to get a list of
  all the fully qualified names in the project and their local aliases.

SYN|SYNOPSIS: paragraph
  A brief description of the topic.

DISCUSSION: content
  This directive starts or continues the main body of a topic. It may be used
  to end a synopsis after one line without using a blank line to explicitly
  end the paragraph.

SECTION: section
  Marks the topic as a child of the specified section.

RELEVANT TO: "title" | tag ...
  Adds this topic to the "See Also" sections of the specified topics. The
  topics may be specified by title or tag. The quotation here is strictly for
  the purposes of escaping spaces; the quote options cannot be used.

SEE ALSO: "title" | tag | URL ...
  Adds the specified topics or URLs to the "See Also" section of this topic.
  Topics may be specified by title or tag. The quotation here is strictly for
  the purposes of escaping spaces; the quote options cannot be used.

SUBHEADING: title
  This directive starts a new subsection of a topic. It may be used as an
  alternative to the ASCII-art method of denoting a subsection (though like all
  directives, you can add ASCII-art around it that is ignored).

ARGS|ARGUMENTS|VALUES:
  An argument or value list. May include paragraphs and other content. Term or
  phrase definition lists are recognized as argument or value names. Only in 
  reference topics.
  
GETTERS|GETTERS AND|& SETTERS|SLOTS|SLOT ACCESSORS:
  A list of getters, setters, or slots available for a class. The only allowed
  content is a term or phrase definition list; each item results in separate
  method topic. Only in class topics. [TODO: This.]

CONDITIONS|SIGNALS|ERRORS|EXCEPTIONS:
  A list of signals raised by a function. May include paragraphs and other
  content. Only in reference topics.

INIT-|MAKE? KEYWORDS:
  A keyword list. Similar to ARGUMENTS. Only in reference topics.

NOTE|WARNING: content
_content
  Shows the text in a note or warning box. The text can have the normal markup
  elements.


Bracket Directives
==================

Some directives must be on a line of their own, others can be included inline.
Bracket directives are case-insensitive. In the syntaxes shown below,
lower-case words are parameters.

... [IMG "imagename" alttext?] ...
  Include an image inline. Scaled to line size. The quotation here is strictly
  for the purposes of escaping spaces and special characters; the quote
  options cannot be used.
  
[FIG "imagename" scale%|linesX?] caption?
  Include a centered image. The quotation here is strictly for the purposes of
  escaping spaces and special characters; the quote options cannot be used.
  
[n]: ...
  Create a footnote. The content may begin on the next line and extends until
  the next section or footnote. The scope of "n" is the current comment block
  or file.
  
... [n] ...
  Refer to the corresponding footnote. The scope of "n" is the current comment
  block or file.
  
... [:n]
  Create a reference target for the preceding line. Only recognized at the end
  of verbatim or code block lines. The scope of "n" is the current comment
  block or file.
  
... [:n] ...
  Refer to the corresponding reference target. Recognized outside of verbatim
  or code block lines. The scope of "n" is the current comment block or file.
  
[CODE]
text
[END CODE?]
  Render "text" as code. Any documented elements in the code are made into
  links if possible. "[:n]" directives are recognized.
  
[VERBATIM|EXAMPLE|DIAGRAM]
text
[END VERBATIM|EXAMPLE|DIAGRAM?]
  Render "text" as plain ASCII in a monospace font. No links are made. "[:n]"
  directives are recognized.
  
... [SYNOPSIS OF topic|"title"] ...
  Shows the synopsis of a topic or documented item. The quotation here is
  strictly for the purposes of escaping spaces; the quote options cannot be
  used.
  
[LIST OF LIBRARIES|MODULES|BINDINGS|CLASSES|FUNCTIONS|VARIABLES|MACROS|
UNBOUND NAMES]
  Shows all libraries, modules, etc.

[LIST OF MODULES|BINDINGS|CLASSES|FUNCTIONS|VARIABLES|MACROS|

  As above, but the list is restricted to the modules, classes, etc., in the
  given fully qualified name, which must be a library or module.
  
[DITTO topic|"title"]
  Make identical to another topic as much as possible. The quotation here is
  strictly for the purposes of escaping spaces; the quote options cannot be
  used.
  
...[HTML] html markup [END HTML?]...
  HTML is rendered exactly. Only applies to HTML output.
  
...[DITA] dita markup [END DITA?]...
  DITA markup is rendered exactly. Only applies to DITA output.
